#Composition
##(a declarative event based algorhitmic composition tool for pyo)

Composition is a small class that can be used to structure an algorithmic composition with pyo.

Composition calls functions at precise(enough) timings and can be used to change parameter of the various utilies in the pyo libraries.

sequencer.py and synths.py are two utility files that are used to make the example.py functional.

Example.py is a minimalist music generator written with Composition.
